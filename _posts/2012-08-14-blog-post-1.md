Dear myself,

Good morning! How are you feeling now?

I know everything is not smooth recently. You slept too late yesterday. Take a good rest! You should work well and work smart instead of extending working time ! Only know how to relax can you work well.

Cheer yourself up! Believe in yourself!

休息是为了更好的工作，我不能再用工作来麻痹自己。何况还不算是工作，只是在学习跟专业无关的知识，比如，如何建立网站！学习是好事，但要安排好时间。目前主要的是如何做好科研，让文章发表得更快更多更好！

Have a nice day
Yu
