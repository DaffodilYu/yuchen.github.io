Indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most widely used transparent conductor in applications such as light emitting diodes, liquid crystal devices, touch screens, and photovoltaic cells. So far, its use has mainly been limited to the visible range (380 nm–750 nm), as it reflects at longer wavelengths and, consequently, its transmission is low. Here, we introduce a simple technique, based on high temperature annealing, which can reduce reflection in the near-infrared range (750 nm–2400 nm). With an optimized set of parameters, we were able to modulate the ITO properties and achieve a high transmission, greater than 80% including substrate contribution, at telecommunication wavelengths (C-band, 1530 nm–1565 nm) while still maintaining high electrical conductivity (resistivity <1.9 × 10−4 Ω cm). By using the newly developed infrared ITO transparent conductor, we demonstrate quantum dot solar cells with 27.7% enhancement in external quantum efficiency at the first exciton peak (1650 nm), and liquid crystal switching devices with 25% enhancement in transmission, with respect to device counterparts incorporating commercially available ITO.
