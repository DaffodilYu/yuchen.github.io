The supercurrent through a holmium/cobalt/holmium-based Josephson junction is investigated by using the extended the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) approach. It is found that the spiral magnetism of the Ho layer can induce both spin-split and spin-flip scatterings, which control the conversion between the spin-singlet and equal spin-triplet pairing correlations, generating a tunable long-range spin-triplet pair ordering. Spin-triplet current sharp peaks variations with the Ho layer thickness as well as a slow decay of the current amplitude with the Co layer thickness are revealed. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the relevant experimental observations (Robinson J. W. A. et al., Science, 329 (2010) 59).
