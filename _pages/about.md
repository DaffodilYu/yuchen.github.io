Welcome to Quantum Garden.

Research
======

It was stated: “the interface is the device”. This sharp and precise phrase coined by the Nobel laureate Herbet Kroemer, practically inspired and formed the basis of my scientific life.

[Programming](https://doctoryuchen.github.io/coding/)
======
* Coding: I often use **Matlab** to process the experiment data, do simulations and calculations. Sometimes I also write **Python** code.
* GUI programming: I also use **Originlab** to process the data for the interaction with colleagues and supervisor. **Ignor** is very interesting. We use the Ignor Pro to cope with the spectroscopy data, in particular, ARPES data.
* Figure: **Adobe illustration** is very powerful to draw 'fake' 3D figures, but it is not free. For 2D figures, **Inksapce** is not a bad choice.

[Learning](https://doctoryuchen.github.io/learning/)
======
I am learning some topics in the physics and mathematics. I will update the learning note from time to time.

[Blog and Peom](https://doctoryuchen.github.io/year-archive/)
======
I am writing blog to practice my English and Chinese poem to record my mood...

[Portfolio](https://doctoryuchen.github.io/portfolio/)
======
Life, science, art, coding and so on...
