Research
======

It was stated: “the interface is the device”. This sharp and precise phrase coined by the Nobel laureate Herbet Kroemer, practically inspired and formed the basis of my scientific life.  Interface is a fertile playground where the symmetry breaking introduces emerging phenomena. Indeed, the complex physics emerging at the strongly correlated oxide interface has captured my main attention. As Researcher in Condensed Matter Physics, I not only deal with experiments, but also enjoy studying theoretical models of the many-particle physics. Passionate and curious I can easily use several instruments to realize self-designed experiments, as well as the programming language.

[Programming](https://doctoryuchen.github.io/coding/)
======
* Coding: I often use Matlab to process the experiment data, do simulations and calculations. Sometimes I also write Python code.
* GUI programming: I also use Originlab to process the data for the interaction with colleages and supervisor. Ignor is very interesting. We use the ignor to cope with the spectroscopy data, in particular, ARPES data.
* Figure: Adobe illustration is very powerful to draw the 'fake' 3D figures, but it is not free. For 2D figures, [Inksapce](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL_v16/html/index.html) is not a bad choice.

Learning
======
I am learning some topics in the physics and mathematics. I will update the learning note from time to time.
