Normal Hall Effect:  

​	In 1879 Edwin H. Hall, conductor

​	In 1881 Edwin H. Hall, ferromagnetic iron 

Anomalous Hall effect: 

​	Berry phase (Berry, 1984).

​	 earlier dubbed “anomalous velocity” by Luttinger, arose naturally in the first microscopic theory of the AHE by Karplus and Luttinger (1954).

> KL showed that when an external electric field is applied to a solid, electrons acquire an additional contribution to their group velocity.

> experiments of Pugh (1930) and Pugh and Lippert (1932) stablished that an empirical relation

Hall resistivity $\rho_{xy} = R_0H_z + R_sM_z$

> The second term represents the Halleffect contribution due to the spontaneous magnetization.

> Kondo considering skew scattering from spin excitations Kondo, 1962, it may be seen that $\rho_{xy}$ also varies as $\rho^2$ at finite T.

Smit argued that the main source of the AHE currents
was asymmetric (skew) scattering from impurities caused
by the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) (Smit, 1955, 1958.)



Three mechanisms

Some concepts I should understand.

1. Berry-phase

   >On the theoretical front, the adoption of the **Berry-phase**
   >concepts has established a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the 	Hall currents... The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in terms of the
   >**Berry-phase curvatures** and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum-mechanical property of a perfect crystal.

2. metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors

3. Skew scattering 

   > An extrinsic mechanism, skew scattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive ferromagnets.

4. Kubo and Keldysh formalisms

   >In addition, more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on
   >the Kubo and Keldysh formalisms are reviewed, taking into account multiband effects, and
   >demonstrate the equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime.
