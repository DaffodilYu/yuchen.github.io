Normal Hall Effect:  

​	In 1879 Edwin H. Hall, conductor

​	In 1881 Edwin H. Hall, ferromagnetic iron 

Anomalous Hall effect: 

​	Berry phase (Berry, 1984).

​	 “anomalous velocity” by Luttinger, arose naturally in the first microscopic theory of the AHE by Karplus and Luttinger (1954).





Some concept I should understand.

1. Berry-phase

   >On the theoretical front, the adoption of the **Berry-phase**
   >concepts has established a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the 	Hall currents... The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in terms of the
   >**Berry-phase curvatures** and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum-mechanical property of a perfect crystal.

2. metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors

3. Skew scattering 

   > An extrinsic mechanism, skew scattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive ferromagnets.

4. Kubo and Keldysh formalisms

   >In addition, more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on
   >the Kubo and Keldysh formalisms are reviewed, taking into account multiband effects, and
   >demonstrate the equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime.
